## Technical Requirements

The workshop assumes that you have available the following resources:
- a computer with internet access,
- a SAS session (may be local or remote), the interface can be: `SAS DMS`, `SAS EG`, or `SAS Studio`, can be `SAS 9.4` or `Viya` with `SPRE`
- the SAS session has:
  - direct internet access or
  - you are able to upload files to the computer hosting your session,
  - (nice to have but not required) the SAS session has `XCMD` option enabled.

Additionally, we assume that *you* wrote at least a few of those: a macro, a function (fcmp, proto, or casl), a format or informat, or an IML module. The more the better.
